# Xcode 26 Compatibility Update

This document describes the changes made to support Xcode 26 while maintaining backwards compatibility with older versions.

## Overview

The MCP simulator commands were updated to support new features in Xcode 26 while maintaining compatibility with older Xcode versions. The solution implements version detection and adaptive behavior based on the installed Xcode version.

## Key Components

### 1. Version Detection (`xcode_version.rs`)

A new module that detects the installed Xcode version and determines feature availability:

- Detects Xcode version using `xcodebuild -version`
- Provides methods to check feature support across different versions
- Supports comparison operators for version checking

### 2. Simulator Interaction (`simulator_interaction.rs`)

A version-aware simulator interaction layer that:

- Adapts to available features based on Xcode version
- Falls back to compatible methods for older versions
- Provides enhanced UI interaction for Xcode 26+

### 3. MCP Tool Integration (`xcode_info_tool.rs`)

A new MCP tool that provides:

- Xcode version information
- Feature availability status
- Compatibility warnings

## Feature Support by Version

| Feature | Minimum Xcode Version | Description |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Boot Status | 11.0 | Check simulator boot status |
| Privacy | 11.4 | Manage privacy permissions |
| UI Commands | 15.0 | Basic UI automation commands |
| Device Appearance | 13.0 | Set light/dark mode |
| Push Notifications | 11.4 | Send push notifications |
| Clone | 12.0 | Clone simulator devices |
| Device Pair | 14.0 | Pair simulators |
| Device Focus | 16.0 | Focus mode |
| Device Streaming | 25.0 | Stream device screen |
| Enhanced UI | 26.0 | Advanced UI interaction |

## Usage

### Check Xcode Version

```bash
# Using the MCP server
{
  "tool_name": "xcode_info",
  "params": {
    "check_features": true
  }
}
```

### Version-Aware UI Interaction

The system automatically detects the Xcode version and uses the appropriate methods:

- **Xcode 26+**: Uses enhanced UI interaction commands (if available)
- **Xcode 15-25**: Uses standard AppleScript-based interaction
- **Xcode <15**: Falls back to XCTest framework or returns appropriate errors

## Implementation Details

### Invalid simctl Commands Removed

The following non-existent `simctl io` commands were identified and removed:
- `simctl io tap` - Does not exist
- `simctl io sendkey` - Does not exist
- `simctl io touch` - Does not exist
- `simctl io swipe` - Does not exist

Valid `simctl io` commands that remain:
- `simctl io screenshot` - Take screenshots
- `simctl io recordVideo` - Record video

### Backwards Compatibility

The implementation ensures backwards compatibility by:

1. Detecting the Xcode version at runtime
2. Checking feature availability before using version-specific commands
3. Falling back to older methods when newer features aren't available
4. Providing clear error messages when features aren't supported

## Testing

Run the version detection test:

```bash
cargo test --package arkavo-test --test xcode_version_test -- --nocapture
```

This will show:
- Detected Xcode version
- Supported features
- Version comparison results

## Future Considerations

As new Xcode versions are released, the system can be easily extended:

1. Add new feature flags to `XcodeVersion`
2. Update `SimulatorInteraction` with new methods
3. Maintain fallback behavior for older versions

The modular design ensures that new features can be added without breaking existing functionality.
