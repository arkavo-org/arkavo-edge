# Intelligent Test Generation with Claude Code SDK

## Overview

Arkavo's intelligent test generation leverages the Claude Code SDK to create an AI-powered testing system that discovers bugs developers don't know exist. By combining Claude's understanding of code with Arkavo's execution infrastructure, we can systematically explore application behavior and find edge cases.

## Architecture

### 1. Domain Model Analysis
The AI analyzes your codebase to understand:
- Data structures and their relationships
- Business rules and constraints
- State transitions and workflows
- API contracts and interfaces

### 2. Test Generation Pipeline

```
Code Analysis → Property Discovery → Test Generation → Execution → Bug Reporting
      ↑                                                              ↓
      └──────────────── Feedback Loop ──────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Integration with Claude Code SDK

When using Arkavo as an MCP server in Claude Code:

1. **Direct Code Access**: Claude can analyze your entire codebase
2. **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands your domain model
3. **Interactive Exploration**: Claude can suggest and execute tests in real-time
4. **Learning Loop**: Each test result improves future test generation

## Test Generation Modes

### Intelligent Mode (`arkavo test --explore`)
- AI autonomously explores application states
- Discovers behavioral bugs through systematic exploration
- Generates minimal reproductions for found issues

### Property Mode (`arkavo test --properties`)
- Discovers invariants that should always be true
- Generates tests to verify these properties
- Examples:
  - "User balance should never be negative"
  - "Total items in cart should match sum of quantities"
  - "Deleted users should not appear in search results"

### Chaos Mode (`arkavo test --chaos`)
- Injects controlled failures (network, disk, memory)
- Tests system resilience and error handling
- Discovers race conditions and edge cases

### Edge Case Mode (`arkavo test --edge-cases`)
- Generates unusual but valid input combinations
- Tests boundary conditions
- Explores state spaces humans wouldn't think of

## MCP Tools for Test Generation

### `generate_tests`
```json
{
  "module": "payment_processor",
  "mode": "properties",
  "focus": "edge_cases"
}
```

### `explore_behavior`
```json
{
  "entry_point": "checkout_flow",
  "depth": 5,
  "strategy": "breadth_first"
}
```

### `verify_invariant`
```json
{
  "invariant": "sum(account.transactions) == account.balance",
  "samples": 1000
}
```

### `inject_chaos`
```json
{
  "failure_type": "network_partition",
  "probability": 0.1,
  "duration": "5s"
}
```

## Example Workflows

### 1. Finding Hidden Bugs in Payment Processing

```bash
# In Claude Code, ask:
"Find bugs in my payment processing logic"

# Arkavo will:
1. Analyze payment-related code
2. Identify critical invariants (no double charges, atomic transactions)
3. Generate test cases exploring edge conditions
4. Report bugs with minimal reproductions
```

### 2. Discovering System Invariants

```bash
# In Claude Code, ask:
"What invariants should always be true in my user system?"

# Arkavo will:
1. Analyze user-related code and data models
2. Propose invariants based on business logic
3. Generate property-based tests
4. Verify invariants hold across all states
```

### 3. Chaos Engineering

```bash
# In Claude Code, ask:
"Test what happens when the network fails during checkout"

# Arkavo will:
1. Identify network-dependent operations
2. Inject failures at critical points
3. Verify system handles failures gracefully
4. Report any data corruption or inconsistencies
```

## Implementation Details

### State Space Exploration
- Uses symbolic execution where possible
- Falls back to concrete execution with intelligent sampling
- Maintains execution tree for backtracking
- Minimizes test cases automatically

### Bug Detection Strategies
- Assertion violations
- Uncaught exceptions
- Deadlocks and race conditions
- Memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Business logic violations
- Security vulnerabilities

### Test Minimization
- Automatically reduces failing tests to minimal reproduction
- Removes irrelevant operations
- Identifies exact conditions triggering bugs
- Generates deterministic reproductions

## Future Enhancements

### Claude Code SDK Integration
- **Semantic Code Search**: Find similar bug patterns across codebases
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Apply learnings from one project to another
- **Natural Language Queries**: "Find bugs similar to CVE-2023-1234"
- **Automated Fix Suggestions**: Generate patches for discovered bugs

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Differential Testing**: Compare implementations
- **Regression Detection**: Ensure bugs don't reappear
- **Performance Testing**: Find performance regressions
- **Security Testing**: Discover vulnerabilities

## Getting Started

1. Install Arkavo and configure as MCP server
2. Ask Claude to explore your code for bugs
3. Review generated test reports
4. Fix discovered issues
5. Add generated tests to your test suite

The combination of Claude's code understanding and Arkavo's execution infrastructure creates a powerful system for finding bugs before they reach production.
