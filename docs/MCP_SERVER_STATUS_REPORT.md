# Arkavo MCP Server Status Report

Based on comprehensive testing, this document outlines the current state of the Arkavo MCP server implementation and critical issues discovered.

## Critical Discovery: Invalid simctl Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Many tools were using non-existent `xcrun simctl io` commands:
- `simctl io tap` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- `simctl io touch` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- `simctl io swipe` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- `simctl io sendkey` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- `simctl io type` - **DOES NOT EXIST**

The only valid `simctl io` operations are:
- `enumerate` - Lists IO ports
- `poll` - Polls IO ports for events
- `recordVideo` - Records screen to video
- `screenshot` - Captures screenshot

## Current Implementation Status

### Working Commands
These commands function correctly and return appropriate errors on failure:

1. **device_management** - Lists and manages simulator devices
2. **simulator_control** - Boot/shutdown simulators
3. **screen_capture** - Takes screenshots (uses valid `simctl io screenshot`)
4. **file_operations** - Read/write simulator files
5. **app_launcher** - Get app info
6. **deep_link** - Opens URLs in simulator

### Partially Working Commands
These commands attempt to work but have limitations:

1. **ui_interaction** - Uses AppleScript as fallback, but:
   - No way to verify if taps actually worked
   - Coordinate calculations are estimates
   - The "analyze_layout" action doesn't actually analyze anything

2. **biometric_auth** - Now returns proper errors, includes:
   - AppleScript attempts for Face ID menu navigation
   - Clear documentation of manual steps required
   - Honest "NOT_AUTOMATED" errors

3. **system_dialog** - Uses AppleScript to attempt button clicks
   - May not find buttons reliably
   - Returns proper MCP errors when failing

### Non-Functional Commands
These commands have fundamental issues:

1. **run_test** - Always returns TOOL_ERROR
2. **passkey_dialog** - Uses invalid tap commands (now fixed to return errors)
3. **biometric_test_scenarios** - Was using invalid commands (now fixed)

### Commands with Mock/Placeholder Implementations

1. **intelligent_bug_finder** - Returns AI-generated responses
2. **discover_invariants** - Returns AI-generated responses  
3. **chaos_test** - Returns test plans without execution
4. **explore_edge_cases** - Returns AI-generated edge cases
5. **mutate_state** - Works but doesn't validate entity/action combinations

## Architecture Issues

### 1. Inconsistent Error Handling
- Some tools return `{"error": {...}}` (correct MCP format)
- Others return `{"success": false, ...}` (incorrect)
- Some return success with mock data

### 2. Parameter Validation
- Most tools don't validate parameters beyond required fields
- No schema validation for parameter values
- Invalid inputs often silently accepted

### 3. State Management
- `query_state`/`mutate_state` don't persist between calls
- State is only in-memory per tool instance

## Recommendations for Production Use

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Remove or Fix Invalid Commands**
   - All `simctl io tap/touch/swipe/sendkey/type` usage must be removed
   - Replace with XCUITest, Appium, or document as "requires manual intervention"

2. **Standardize Error Responses**
   - All failures should return `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`
   - Never return `{"success": false}`

3. **Document Limitations Clearly**
   - Each tool should document what it can and cannot do
   - Be explicit about manual steps required

### For Reliable iOS Automation

Consider these alternatives:
1. **XCUITest** - Apple's official UI testing framework
2. **Appium** - Cross-platform automation with `mobile:` commands
3. **Facebook's WebDriverAgent** - HTTP-based automation
4. **EarlGrey** - Google's iOS UI automation framework

### Tool-Specific Fixes Needed

1. **ui_interaction**
   - Remove "analyze_layout" or implement actual vision analysis
   - Document that tap verification is not possible
   - Consider removing coordinate-based interactions entirely

2. **run_test**
   - Either implement or remove entirely
   - Current implementation is misleading

3. **State Management Tools**
   - Add parameter validation
   - Implement persistent storage
   - Or clearly mark as "in-memory only"

4. **AI-Powered Tools**
   - Clearly indicate these are AI-generated suggestions
   - Don't present as actual test execution

## Conclusion

The Arkavo MCP server has significant issues stemming from the use of non-existent simulator commands. While workarounds using AppleScript have been implemented, they are unreliable and cannot guarantee success. For production iOS automation, proper tools like XCUITest or Appium should be used instead of attempting to automate through simulator commands.

The server works well for file operations, device management, and screenshot capture, but should not be relied upon for UI interaction or biometric testing without significant architectural changes.
