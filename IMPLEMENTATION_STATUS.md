# Implementation Status

## Completed in this session:

### 1. Enhanced `run_test` Tool ✅
- Discovers and runs actual tests from repositories
- Supports multiple languages (Rust, Swift, JavaScript, Python, Go)
- Properly categorizes tests (unit, integration, performance, UI)
- Returns real test execution results

### 2. Added `list_tests` Tool ✅
- Discovers all available tests in a repository
- Supports filtering by name and type
- Works with multiple project types
- Enhanced Swift test discovery for iOS projects

### 3. Implemented State Management ✅
- Created `StateStore` module for persistent state management
- Updated `QueryStateKit` to use real state storage
- Updated `MutateStateKit` with full CRUD operations
- Updated `SnapshotKit` to create/restore/list snapshots
- All state management tools now share a common state store

## Remaining Stubs to Implement:

### High Priority (Core Functionality):
1. **Chat Command** (`chat.rs`)
   - Currently just echo loop
   - Needs: Repository context, streaming diffs, agent logic

2. **Apply Command** (`apply.rs`)
   - Completely unimplemented
   - Needs: Plan execution, file writing, git commits

3. **Vault Command** (`vault.rs`)
   - Completely unimplemented
   - Needs: Import/export functionality

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features):
4. **iOS UI Tools** (`ios_tools.rs`)
   - Tap coordinates hardcoded
   - UI queries return mock data
   - Text input uses echo command
   - Needs: Real xcrun simctl integration

5. **AI Analysis Engine** (`analysis_engine.rs`)
   - Returns mock data when no API key
   - Needs: Fallback to local analysis or better mocks

6. **Intelligent Test Runner** (`intelligent_runner.rs`)
   - Returns hardcoded file lists
   - Needs: Real code discovery and analysis

## Ready to Merge:
- The test discovery and execution enhancements are complete
- State management is now fully functional
- These improvements fix critical functionality gaps

## Recommendation:
1. Merge current changes to main (test tools + state management)
2. Create separate PRs for:
   - Core commands (chat, apply, vault)
   - iOS tools enhancement
   - AI integration improvements
