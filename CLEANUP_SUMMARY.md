# Code Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Excessive Debug Logging

#### idb_wrapper.rs
- Removed verbose debug prints for initialization, extraction, connection, and tap operations
- Kept only essential error messages for production use
- Removed timing measurements and status updates that were used for debugging

#### calibration/server.rs  
- Removed verbose calibration process logging
- Kept only essential status updates and error messages
- Removed IDB status check debug output

#### idb_recovery.rs
- Removed debug prints for process killing operations

#### frameworks_data.rs
- Removed debug print for framework discovery

### 2. Code Organization
- Added missing module declarations in mod.rs (state_tools, test_tools)
- All IDB-related modules are properly gated with `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`

### 3. Build Script (build.rs)
- Left build script logging intact as it provides useful feedback during compilation
- These messages are appropriate for a build process

## Production-Ready State

The codebase is now cleaner and more suitable for production:
- Removed ~50+ debug print statements
- Maintained essential error reporting
- Code is more professional and less verbose
- All functionality remains intact

## What Was Kept

- Error messages that help diagnose production issues
- Build-time feedback in build.rs
- Essential status updates for long-running operations
- Platform-specific conditional compilation guards
