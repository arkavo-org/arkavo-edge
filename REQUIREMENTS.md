# Arkavo Edge â€” Openâ€‘Source Requirements

*Last updated: 26 Apr 2025*

> **Goal** Provide an OSS toolkit that matches or exceeds the developerâ€‘centric capabilities of **Claude Code** and **Aider** while keeping proprietary logic private.
>
> **Audience** AIâ€‘agent developers and framework maintainers who need a secure, costâ€‘smart runtime and CLI for multiâ€‘file code transformations.

## Scope Overview

| Layer                 | Included in OSS                                        | Proprietary / Closed                             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **CLI Core**          | `arkavo` binary, command parser, multiâ€‘step agent loop | â€“                                                |
| **Terminal UI**       | GPUâ€‘accelerated terminal integration                   | â€“                                                |

## Functional Requirements

### CLI Commands

| Command          | Description                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arkavo chat`    | Conversational agent with repo context & streaming diff previews.  |
| `arkavo plan`    | Generates a change plan (tasks + affected files) before code edit. |
| `arkavo apply`   | Executes plan, writes files, commits with descriptive message.     |
| `arkavo test`    | Runs project tests; streams failures back to agent loop.           |
| `arkavo vault â€¦` | Import/export notes to **Edge Vault**.                             |

### Repository Awareness

1. Parse up to **10 000 source files**; create a vector + symbol index (SQLite).
2. Support multiâ€‘file refactors; ensure compilable compileâ€‘unit after apply.
3. Produce **unified diffs** for every LLM edit ([aider.chat](https://aider.chat/docs/unified-diffs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### Git Workflow

1. Initialize repo if absent.
2. Autoâ€‘create feature branch `arkavo/<timestamp>`.
3. After each `apply`, commit with an AIâ€‘generated message.
4. Provide `arkavo undo` to revert last commit.

### Protocol Layer

- Full MCP v1.0 and A2A 2025â€‘04 specs.
- Streaming chunk support with backâ€‘pressure.

### Security & Privacy

- OpenTDF AESâ€‘256 envelope on **all** outbound payloads.

### Edge Vault (Community Edition)

- Arkavo Community Web on `localhost:8191`.
- Supports Markdown docs and code snippets with tag search.

### Test Harness Adapter

- Detect project language (Python/JS/Go/Rust).
- Execute tests; capture stdout/stderr and coverage.

## Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements

| Attribute         | Requirement                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**   | â‰¤50 ms from router response to diff render; 60 fps scroll.   |
| **Footprint**     | Binary â‰¤15 MB; RAM â‰¤150 MB typical.                          |
| **Portability**   | macOS (arm64), Linux (x64/aarch64).                          |
| **Build & CI**    | `cargo build --release`; GitHub Actions with Zig MUSL build. |
| **Quality Gates** | `cargo clippy -D warnings`, test coverage â‰¥85 %.             |
| **License**       | MIT (code), CCâ€‘BYâ€‘4.0 (docs).                                |

---

## Out of Scope (Open Source)

- Smart Router (cost/capability routing).
- Automated dataâ€‘tagging & sensitivity heuristics.
- Enterprise SSO, fineâ€‘grained RBAC, analytics backend.
- Proprietary model weights.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `arkavo plan` lists tasks and files for a refactor across â‰¥3 files.
2. `arkavo apply` commits unified diff and code compiles (languageâ€‘specific check).
3. `arkavo test` runs project tests; failures streamed back.
4. Encryption on/off verified by roundâ€‘trip unit tests.
5. CI pipeline green on macOS & Linux runners.

---

## Contribution Guidelines (Abridged)

1. Fork â†’ Branch â†’ PR against `main`.
2. Sign DCO in each commit.
3. Include tests + docs for new code.
4. No proprietary internals in PRs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Summary & Priority

* **P0 â€” MVP**
    * Conversational CLI with repo context and unifiedâ€‘diff edits
    * Git autoâ€‘commit & `undo`
    * MCP & A2A client (stub router)
    * OpenTDF encryption (local Arkavo Keystore)
    * GPU terminal UI
    * Edge Vault basic (SQLite + web UI)

* **P1 â€” Nearâ€‘Term**
    * `plan` step with task graph
    * Languageâ€‘agnostic test harness
    * Multiâ€‘language repo indexing
    * HashiCorp Vault key backend

* **P2 â€” Future**
    * Windows build
    * Postgres storage & dashboards
    * Fineâ€‘tune on private knowledge base
    * Analytics & policy editor

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Developer Experience First** Focus engineering sprints on the P0 feature set to deliver a fast, frictionâ€‘free first run and tight editâ€‘apply loop.
2. **Highlight Security Differentiators** Feature OpenTDF encryption and onâ€‘prem/offline modes prominently in docs and marketing collateral.
3. **Expand Testing Strategy** Maintain â‰¥85 % coverage *and* add performance regression tests (latency & memory) in CI.
4. **Document the Boundary** Provide architectural diagrams and API contracts that clearly separate OSS modules from proprietary Smart Router components.
5. **Cultivate Community** Launch a Discord/Matrix space, tag good first issues, and schedule monthly office hours to drive openâ€‘core adoption.
6. **Execute Roadmap** Proceed with licensing, public roadmap publication, designâ€‘partner pilots, and benchmark shootsâ€‘out versus Claude Code & Aider.

## Challenges, Risks & Mitigations

| Area                                   | Risk / Ambiguity                                             | Mitigation                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiâ€‘file Refactor**                | LLM edits may leave project uncompilable & languageâ€‘specific | **P0**: run formatter & linter postâ€‘edit, autoâ€‘rollback on failure  **P1**: plug in language servers for compile checks |
| **Repo Mapper vs. Ranking Heuristics** | OSS mapper may feel weak without proprietary ranking         | Ship baseline TFâ€‘IDF + symbol graph; Smart Router adds advanced weighting                                               |
| **Aggressive Perf Targets**            | 15 MB binary & 50 ms render may be hard                      | Continuous perf tests in CI; enforce crateâ€‘level size budgets                                                           |
| **Ghostty Dependency**                 | Windows timeline tied to Ghostty DLL                         | Provide TTY fallback; track upstream milestones                                                                         |
| **Router Boundary**                    | Need clear interface to closed Smart Router                  | Define `router.toml` + gRPC stub; ship passâ€‘through router with BYO key                                                 |
| **LLM Connectivity OOTB**              | Users must supply model creds                                | CLI setup wizard; optional Ollama local model download                                                                  |
| **Commit Messages**                    | OSS lacks AI commit summaries                                | Basic template (`feat: {task}`) in OSS; advanced prompts proprietary                                                    |
| **Edge Vault CE Value**                | Utility limited without RBAC                                 | Emphasise offline KB use cases; CSV import/export                                                                       |
