# Arkavo Edge â€” Openâ€‘Source Requirements

*Last updated: 26 May 2025*

> **Goal** Provide an OSS toolkit that matches or exceeds the developerâ€‘centric capabilities of **Claude Code** and **Aider** while keeping proprietary logic private.
>
> **Audience** AIâ€‘agent developers and framework maintainers who need a secure, costâ€‘smart runtime and CLI for multiâ€‘file code transformations.

## Functional Requirements

### CLI Commands

| Command          | Description                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arkavo chat`    | Conversational agent with repo context & streaming diff previews.  |
| `arkavo plan`    | Generates a change plan (tasks + affected files) before code edit. |
| `arkavo apply`   | Executes plan, writes files, commits with descriptive message.     |
| `arkavo test`    | AIâ€‘driven test execution with BDD support & mobile app testing.    |
| `arkavo vault â€¦` | Import/export notes to **Edge Vault**.                             |

### Repository Awareness

1. Parse up to **10 000 source files**; create a vector + symbol index (SQLite).
2. Support multiâ€‘file refactors; ensure compilable compileâ€‘unit after apply.
3. Produce **unified diffs** for every LLM edit ([aider.chat](https://aider.chat/docs/unified-diffs.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### Git Workflow

1. Initialize repo if absent.
2. Autoâ€‘create feature branch `arkavo/<timestamp>`.
3. After each `apply`, commit with an AIâ€‘generated message.
4. Provide `arkavo undo` to revert last commit.

### Protocol Layer

- Full MCP v1.0 and A2A 2025â€‘04 specs.
- Streaming chunk support with backâ€‘pressure.

### Security & Privacy

- OpenTDF AESâ€‘256 envelope on **all** outbound payloads.

### Edge Vault (Community Edition)

- Arkavo Community Web on `localhost:8191`.
- Supports Markdown docs and code snippets with tag search.

### Test Harness (AIâ€‘Powered Testing)

#### Overview
The test harness provides a unified AIâ€‘driven testing framework that bridges businessâ€‘readable BDD specifications with deep behavioral testing capabilities for web and mobile applications.

#### Core Components

1. **Gherkin/BDD Layer**
  - Parse `.feature` files with Given/When/Then syntax
  - Natural language test specification support
  - AIâ€‘powered step mapping (no manual bindings required)
  - Businessâ€‘readable test reports in Markdown/HTML

2. **AI Planning Engine**
  - LLMâ€‘based test generation from natural language objectives
  - Propertyâ€‘based testing with invariant discovery
  - Stateful exploration with automatic minimization
  - Metamorphic relation identification

3. **Mobile Bridge (iOS/Android)**
  - Native FFI bridge to Swift/Kotlin test frameworks
  - Direct app state inspection and mutation
  - Snapshot/restore with branching execution paths
  - Hotâ€‘reload test injection without rebuilds

4. **Execution Modes**
  - **BDD Mode**: Execute Gherkin scenarios with AI step interpretation
  - **Exploratory Mode**: AI autonomously explores app states
  - **Property Mode**: Continuous invariant checking
  - **Chaos Mode**: Deterministic failure injection

5. **Performance Features**
  - Dynamic test compilation (no xcodebuild cycles)
  - Parallel execution across device pool
  - Subâ€‘50ms action execution via native bridges
  - Memoryâ€‘efficient state snapshots with LMDB

#### Supported Platforms

| `arkavo test --explore`        | AI explores app for specified duration                         |
| `arkavo test --chaos`          | Inject failures while testing                                  |
| `arkavo test --device iPhone`  | Target specific device/simulator                               |
| `arkavo test --plan <goal>`    | Generate test plan from natural language goal                  |

## Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements

| Attribute         | Requirement                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**   | â‰¤50 ms from router response to diff render; 60 fps scroll.   |
| **Footprint**     | Binary â‰¤15 MB; RAM â‰¤150 MB typical.                          |
| **Portability**   | macOS (arm64), Linux (x64/aarch64).                          |
| **Build & CI**    | `cargo build --release`; GitHub Actions with Zig MUSL build. |
| **Quality Gates** | `cargo clippy -D warnings`, test coverage â‰¥85 %.             |
| **License**       | MIT (code), CCâ€‘BYâ€‘4.0 (docs).                                |

## Out of Scope (Open Source)

- Smart Router (cost/capability routing).
- Automated dataâ€‘tagging & sensitivity heuristics.
- Enterprise SSO, fineâ€‘grained RBAC, analytics backend.
- Proprietary model weights.
- Cloudâ€‘based device farms for testing.
- Advanced flaky test detection algorithms.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `arkavo plan` lists tasks and files for a refactor across â‰¥3 files.
2. `arkavo apply` commits unified diff and code compiles (languageâ€‘specific check).
3. `arkavo test` executes BDD scenarios and generates business reports.
4. `arkavo test --explore` discovers at least one invariant violation in sample app.
5. Mobile bridge successfully snapshots and restores app state.
6. Encryption on/off verified by roundâ€‘trip unit tests.
7. CI pipeline green on macOS & Linux runners.

---

## Contribution Guidelines (Abridged)

1. Fork â†’ Branch â†’ PR against `main`.
2. Sign DCO in each commit.
3. Include tests + docs for new code.
4. No proprietary internals in PRs.

## Challenges, Risks & Mitigations

| Area                                   | Risk / Ambiguity                                             | Mitigation                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiâ€‘file Refactor**                | LLM edits may leave project uncompilable & languageâ€‘specific | **P0**: run formatter & linter postâ€‘edit, autoâ€‘rollback on failure  **P1**: plug in language servers for compile checks |
| **Repo Mapper vs. Ranking Heuristics** | OSS mapper may feel weak without proprietary ranking         | Ship baseline TFâ€‘IDF + symbol graph; Smart Router adds advanced weighting                                               |
| **Aggressive Perf Targets**            | 15 MB binary & 50 ms render may be hard                      | Continuous perf tests in CI; enforce crateâ€‘level size budgets                                                           |
| **Ghostty Dependency**                 | Windows timeline tied to Ghostty DLL                         | Provide TTY fallback; track upstream milestones                                                                         |
| **Router Boundary**                    | Need clear interface to closed Smart Router                  | Define `router.toml` + gRPC stub; ship passâ€‘through router with BYO key                                                 |
| **LLM Connectivity OOTB**              | Users must supply model creds                                | CLI setup wizard; optional Ollama local model download                                                                  |
| **Commit Messages**                    | OSS lacks AI commit summaries                                | Basic template (`feat: {task}`) in OSS; advanced prompts proprietary                                                    |
| **Edge Vault CE Value**                | Utility limited without RBAC                                 | Emphasise offline KB use cases; CSV import/export                                                                       |
| **Mobile Testing Complexity**          | FFI bridges add build complexity                             | Preâ€‘built binaries for common platforms; Docker images with bridges installed                                           |
| **AI Test Determinism**                | LLMâ€‘generated tests may be flaky                             | Seedâ€‘based generation; snapshot test outputs for regression detection                                                   |
